Change Log (2025-11-12): – Updated loop to include max time restraints.

### **Module 2 — Plan Builder (Options → Days)**

Create a short list of candidate activities (e.g., attractions, restaurants, parks).  
Each activity includes type, estimated duration, cost range, and distance.

Use a simple loop to build days:

for each day:  
    pick Morning activity that lasts a maximum of 1 hour (near lodging) 
    pick Midday activity that lasts a maximum of 1 hour (close by)  
    pick Afternoon activity that lasts a maximum of 1 hour (different theme)  
    pick Evening restaurant or optional event that lasts a maximum of 1 hour
